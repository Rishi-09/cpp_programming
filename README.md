A detailed view --
This section focuses on fundamental concepts and introductory topics that lay the groundwork for understanding and using C++ effectively.

    Setup and Basics:
        Installing a C++ compiler and IDE.
        "Hello, World!" program.
        Input/Output (cin, cout).

    Core Syntax:
        Variables and Data Types (int, float, char, etc.).
        Operators (arithmetic, logical, relational).
        Control Structures (if, switch, loops like for, while, do-while).

    Functions:
        Defining and using functions.
        Pass-by-value vs. pass-by-reference.
        Inline functions.

    Arrays and Strings:
        Basic arrays (1D and 2D).
        C-style strings and std::string.

    Pointers:
        Basics of pointers (address-of operator, dereferencing).
        Pointer arithmetic.

    File Handling:
        Reading and writing to files using fstream.

        Intermediate

This section involves more advanced syntax, concepts, and the standard library to solve real-world problems.

    Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
        Classes and Objects.
        Constructors and Destructors.
        Inheritance (single, multiple).
        Polymorphism (virtual functions).
        Operator Overloading.

    Dynamic Memory Management:
        new and delete.
        Smart pointers (std::shared_ptr, std::unique_ptr).

    STL (Standard Template Library):
        Containers (vector, deque, map, set).
        Iterators.
        Algorithms (sort, find, binary_search).

    Advanced File Handling:
        Binary files.
        File pointers (seekg, seekp).

    Exception Handling:
        try, catch, and throw.
        Custom exceptions.

    Templates:
        Function templates.
        Class templates.

    Namespaces:
        Defining and using namespaces.

        Expert

This section delves into complex, high-performance, and cutting-edge features and techniques.

    Advanced OOP:
        Abstract classes.
        Virtual inheritance.
        Multiple dispatch.

    Metaprogramming:
        Template metaprogramming (TMP).
        Concepts and constraints (C++20).

    Concurrency:
        Multithreading (std::thread, std::mutex).
        Asynchronous programming (std::async, std::future).

    Move Semantics:
        r-value references.
        Move constructors and move assignment operators.

    Advanced Templates:
        Variadic templates.
        Template specialization and partial specialization.

    Modern C++ Features:
        Lambda expressions.
        std::optional, std::variant, and std::any.
        Ranges and coroutines (C++20).

    Custom Memory Management:
        Allocators.
        Memory pools.

    Performance Optimization:
        Inline assembly.
        SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data).
        Profiling and benchmarking.

    Design Patterns:
        Singleton, Factory, Observer, etc.
        Dependency injection.

    Interfacing with Other Languages:
        Interfacing C++ with C, Python (e.g., using Boost.Python or pybind11).
